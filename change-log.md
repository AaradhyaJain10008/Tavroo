## 📅 Last Session Footprint

- **Timestamp:** 2026-09-30 02:35 IST
- **Active Task:** Upgraded Tavroo Interactive 3D Showcase into an elite, realistic 3D runway mannequin engine with authentic streetwear replication, smart gender morphing, theme-blended scrollbars, and polished toolkit UI.
- **Git State:** On `main`, tracking GitHub repository `AaradhyaJain10008/Diya_ICA` through `origin`.
- **Hosting Engine:** Continuous cloud deployment automated via Vercel GitHub Webhook.

## 📍 Last Edited Points & Core Logic

### 1. 3D Realistic Mannequin Anatomy & Natural Hands
- **Facial Sculpting:** Sculpted anatomical features including almond-shaped runway eyes (sclera white, iris, pupil, high-specular cornea reflection), arched eyebrows, defined nasal bridge with nostrils, and high-fashion lips with Cupid's bow.
- **Natural Runway Posed Hands:** Replaced primitive blocks with anatomically tapered palms, rounded thenar muscle pads, angled opposing thumbs, and naturally cascaded, curling fingers (index, middle, ring, pinky) in relaxed runway posture.
- **Neck & Clavicles:** Integrated defined collarbones (clavicles) and sternocleidomastoid contours transitioning into the shoulders.

### 2. Authentic Streetwear Garment Replication
- **Deconstructed Graphic Tee:** Integrated front graphic decal plane (`z = 0.178`, outside chest mesh) with streetwear typography (`FRAYD STUDIO // ARCHIVE 2026`, `WEAR YOUR POINT OF VIEW`), technical specs, and a barcode.
- **Live Typography Updates:** Typing in the "Custom Typography & Decal" input dynamically renders text (e.g. *DIYA STUDIO*) onto the 3D tee in real-time.
- **Garment Presets:**
  - *Hyper-Object Hoodie:* 3D cowl behind neck, front kangaroo pouch pocket, drop-shoulder sleeves, and hanging drawstrings with metallic aglets.
  - *Acid-Wash Biker Vest:* Wide asymmetrical moto lapels, heavy diagonal chrome zipper, and waist belt with silver buckle.
  - *Oversized Denim Jacket:* Turn-down collar, dual chest flap pockets, and front button placket.
  - *Modular Cargo Trousers:* 3D box accordion cargo pockets on outer thighs.
  - *Footwear:* Chunky platform sneakers, combat boots, canvas kicks, chelsea boots, and cyber slides with detailed soles and textures.

### 3. Theme-Blended Custom Scrollbars
- Targeted `*::-webkit-scrollbar`, `.panel::-webkit-scrollbar`, and Firefox `scrollbar-color`.
- Set track to `background: transparent`, eliminating Windows default grey scrollbar gutters.
- Styled 6px thumb with glowing magenta-to-purple gradient (`linear-gradient(180deg, #ff007f, #7928ca)`), shifting to cyan on hover.

### 4. Smart Gender Morphing & Hairstyle Synchronization
- **Female:** Soft runway curves, cinched waist taper, flared hips, soft jawline, and automatic switch to *3D Editorial Side-Part Waves*.
- **Male:** Broad athletic shoulders, chiseled square jawline, athletic V-taper chest, and automatic switch to *3D Modern Textured Crop*.
- **Non-Binary:** Sleek architectural androgynous silhouette and automatic switch to *3D Textured Afro High Puff* with gold styling cuff.
- **Dynamic Re-Fitting:** Switching genders triggers `rebuildAllActiveGarments()`, adapting all equipped garments to the new body proportions.

### 5. UI Consistency & Toolkit Polish
- **Back Button:** Replaced plain white outline with a glass pill button (`.btn-text`) with cyan border glow, backdrop blur, and hover slide animation.
- **Step Badges:** Replaced raw text bullets with gradient badges `(1)`, `(2)`, `(3)`, `(4)` and uniform spacing between control groups.
- **Color Picker Card:** Styled the fabric dye selector into a dark glass card with a glowing preview swatch, live uppercase HEX readout (e.g. `#141318`), and helper subtitle.

## 🐛 Open Quirks & Technical Blocks

- None. All 3D WebGL scenes, OrbitControls, materials, decals, and styling run natively in browser without CORS or external asset dependencies.

## ⏭️ Immediate Next Execution Objectives

1. Push all committed changes to GitHub repository `origin/main` to trigger live Vercel deployment.
2. Verify live production build on Vercel.
